#### How to use it?
This java Apllication needs some kind of Mobile Device Emulator or Interface.
I have tested it with Teamviewer and Nox Appplayer. You can configure points of the Clashroyale app, where the bot automatically clicks.
These clicks can cause Troops to spawn or Buttons to be Pressed.
